# **Air Quality Index Project 🌍🔍**
---

## *Project description*

This project aims to analyse and visualise data related to air quality, focusing on the Air Quality Index (AQI) and assessing the level of risk associated with pollutant values. In addition, meteorological data is integrated for a more complete understanding of the environment.

## *Main features*

- Analysis of air quality data.
- Calculation and representation of the AQI.
- Assessment of the level of risk associated with pollutant values.
- Integration of meteorological data.
- Data visualisation through graphs and tables.
- Creation and training of a machine learning model to predict the AQI.

## *Technologies used*

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- Matplotlib/Seaborn 📊
- Scikit-learn (for the machine learning model).
- Other relevant modules for data analysis and visualisation.
- Weather data API (e.g. OpenWeatherMap). 🌦️

## *Project structure*

- `data/`: Folder containing the datasets used.
- `scripts/`: Python files for data analysis, visualisation and modelling.
- `results/`: Folder that may contain intermediate or final results.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file). 📚
